# OASH (Open source Automated Smart Home)
Open source cloud based hub with abilities to connect to any internet connected device!

# One hub to rule them all!
Home automation is a growing space and every device has it's own way to interact with it. This allows you combine them, make new ones and let your home handle itself based on your preferences automatically.

## What do I mean by that?
Imagine this you're sitting at home on your sofa and it gets way too warm due to the afternoon sun shining through your window. No need to get up, because your window begins to open by itself in order to cool it down. An hour later it starts to drizzle (a summer storm) but luckily your home hub knew that would happen and it closed your windows for you!

That's just one example of what the Home Hub could do for you. The great thing about it is that you can add any device to be automated through the hub! Imagine automating your home lighting, water heaters, sprinklers, etc. based on your movement, usage, time of day, and weather. Your regular home can now become a smart home!

## How does it work?
Still being developed

## Why do I care?
If you don't plan on having a cool house (you don't). If you don't have other devices in your home like a Nest, WeMo, etc. (you don't yet)However! If you've got enough things on your mind and want to let your house handle itself, you definitely will care! Combine all your home devices under one hub that will rule them all.

## The Future

* Community Growth! The more people that automate devices based on the hub and come up with recipes, the more robust the functionality will be!
* Tie into nest api as a device or get their temperature settings. And wemo or smart things to integrate into their systems.
* App that will automatically turn on security mode when you are away.
* Get data from multiple spark cores like temperature in your house or motion and toggle multiple devices based off of spark too.
* Touch LCD for toggling on a hub device in your home.
