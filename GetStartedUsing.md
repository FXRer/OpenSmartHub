#I want to use it!

Awesome! Here are the steps to get started.
There are three main components:
* Online-hub - this web component will act as the UI to handle configurations easily on the fly. (I host mine in Azure)
* A device to host the local-hub - this will act as the brain for the whole automation hub.
* Your devices - these are the components that will interact through the hub.

##Setup the Online-Hub
0. Open the online-hub folder
0. 

##Setup the Local-Hub
0. Install Nodejs on your local-hub machine
0. Place the local-hub folder on the machine
0. Run the local-hub.js program using `node local-hub.js`
0. Your local-hub is now setup!
0. If you ever want to update the local-hub with the latest possible devices, the easiest way will be to copy and replace the files (don't delete since that will remove your securityCredentials javascript file.
