Awesome! Here are the steps to get started.
There are three main components:
* Online-hub - this web component will act as the UI to handle configurations easily on the fly. (I host mine in Azure)
* A device to host the local-hub - this will act as the brain for the whole automation hub.
* Your devices - these are the components that will interact through the hub.
